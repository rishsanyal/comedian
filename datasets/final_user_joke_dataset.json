They agreed to give each other5 years to breed the two most powerful fighting dogs ever.The winning dog's country would be entitled to dominate the world. The losing side would have to submit and lay down its arms.The Russians searched their vast country to find the meanest, most vicious Doberman and Rottweiler breeds and crossed them with the biggest, most dangerous Siberian wolves.They selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from each litter and fed it a diet of steroids and trained them to be lethal attack dogs. After five years of fierce breeding, Russiahad managed to create the biggest, most vicious dog the world had ever seen.Finally Russia and America met in Switzerland to let their dogs fight for world domination. Although its cage had 4-inch-thick reinforced steel-bars, everyone was afraid to even go near the Russian monster-dog. When the Russians saw the American dog, they burst into laughter. America had sent a weird looking 9-foot-long Dachshund! The Russian breeders felt a little sorry for the Dachshund, because they knew it didn't have the slightest chance to last even 10 seconds against Russia's killer.When the bell announced the beginning of the fight, the Russian dog leaped out of its cage, snarled, and charged the American Dachshund.The Dachshund slowly waddled out of its cage towards the Russian dog. But just when the Russian champion looked like it was going to bite the Dachshund's neck, the Dachshund opened its mouth and swallowed the Russian dog with one bite.

The new element, tentatively named Administratium, has no protons or electrons, and thus has an atomic weight of 0. However, it does have one neuron, 125 assistant neutrons, 75 vice neutrons, and 111 assistant vice neutrons. This gives it an atomic mass of 312. These 312 particles are held together in a nucleus by a force that involves the continuous exchange of particles called morons.\n\nSince it has no electrons, Administratium is totally inert. However, it can be detected chemically, since it impedes every reaction it comes into contact with. According to its discovers, a tiny amount of Administratium caused one reaction to take over four days to complete; the normal reaction time is less than one second.\n\nAdministratium has a normal half life of approximately three years, at which time it does not actually decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which neutrons, vice neutrons, and assistant vice neutrons exchange places. Studies have shown that the atomic mass usually increases after each reorganization.\n\nResearch at other laboratories indicates that Administratium occurs naturally in the atmosphere. It tends to concentrate at certain points, such as governmental agencies, large corporations, and universities. It is always found in the newest, best appointed, and best maintained buildings.\n\nScientists point out that Administratium is known to be toxic at any level of concentration and can easily destroy any productive reactions where it is allowed to accumulate. Attempts are being made to determine how Administratium can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage, but results to date are not promising.","jester":0,"reddit":0,"stupidstuff":1,"toxic":0.4824694097,"severe_toxic":0.081468828,"obscene":0.1299293339,"threat":0.082722038,"insult":0.122005634,"identity_hate":0.1014046893,"anger":0.0019290786,"disgust":0.0102257915,"fear":0.0005588328,"joy":0.0033610233,"neutral":0.9794344306,"sadness":0.001805115,"surprise":0.0026857315,"misogynist":0.0002339589,"sexist":0.0132927243,"age_24":0.2666666667,"age_26":0.1,"gender_Female":0.2666666667,"gender_Male":0.1,"ethnicity_Middle Eastern":0.0,"ethnicity_South East Asian":0.3666666667,"country_India":0.3666666667,"country_Iran":0.0,"location_San Francisco":0.3666666667},{"joke_id":"SS640","USF1000_rating":8,"USF1001_rating":10,"USF1002_rating":0,"datasource_joke_id":"640","jokeText":"The lookout aboard a clipper ship spots a pirate ship approaching, and yells down to the captain.
