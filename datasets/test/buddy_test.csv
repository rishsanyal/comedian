0,"Three blondes were all applying for the last available position on the Highway Patrol. The detective conducting the interview looked at the 3 of them and said, ""So ya'll want to be a cop, eh?""The blondes all nodded. The detective got up, opened a file drawer and pulled out a file folder. Sitting back down, he opened it up and withdrew a picture, and said, ""To be a detective, you have to be able to detect. You must be able to notice things such as distinguishing features and oddities such as scars, etc.""So he stuck the photo in the face of the 1st blonde and withdrew it after about 2 seconds. ""Now, he said, ""did you notice any distinguishing features about the man?""The blonde immediately said, ""Yes, I did. He has only one eye!""The detective shook his head and said, ""Of course he has only one eye in this picture! It's a profile of his face! You're dismissed!""The 1st blonde hung her head and walked out of the office. The detective then turned to the 2nd blonde, stuck the photo in her face for 2 seconds, pulled it back and said, ""What about you? Notice anything unusual or outstanding about this man?""""Yes! He only has one ear!""The detective put his head in his hand and exclaimed, ""Didn't you hear what I just told the other lady? This is a profile of the man's face! Of course you can only see one ear!! You're excused, too!""The 2nd blonde sheepishly walked out of the office. The detective turned his attention to the 3rd and last blonde and said, ""This is probably a waste of time, but......."" He flashed the photo in her face for a couple of seconds and withdrew it, saying ""All right. Did you notice anything distinguishing or unusual about this man?""The blonde said, ""I did. This man wears contact lenses.""The detective frowned, took another look at the picture and began looking at some of the papers in the folder. He looked up at the blonde with a puzzled expression and said, ""You're absolutely right! His bio says he wears contacts... How in the world could you tell that by looking at this picture?""The blonde rolled her eyes and said, ""Well duh! With only one eye and one ear, he certainly can't wear glasses!""",0.7935501337051392,0.012684153392910957,0.07000093907117844,0.01488562859594822,0.07804999500513077,0.030829181894659996,0.23307545483112335,0.19082652032375336,0.03777068480849266,0.036991752684116364,0.1388961523771286,0.0017769914120435715,0.36066243052482605,0.001058658817782998,0.054309744387865067,4.0
